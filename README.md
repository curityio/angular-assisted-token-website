This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.21.

## Quick Start

In this example, an API call is made using access token received from a Curity server after authentication using the "assisted token flow". The client uses the Angular framework and shows how to use this development tool to perform the assisted token flow. For that, it calls a RESTful API that is hosted in a separate node server. To start both, simply invoke the following command:

```nodemon
npm start
```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:4200 in a web browser.

You can make changes to the Angular single-page application (SPA) to perform your own experimentation. If you do, the changes you make to the app's source files will automatically reload. If you change the API that the client invokes, you do not need to start the node API server. To do this, run `ng serve` instead of `npm start`. If you want to start only the API, you can do so with the command `node server/server.js`.

```nodemon
npm start
```

## The Curity Identity Server Configuration

In order to run this example you need to setup some configurations in the Curity Identity Server. The easiest way is to [download and install the sample configuration](https://developer.curity.io/release/8.5.3/configuration-samples) from the Curity developer portal. This sample configuration already has an authentication profile and an OAuth profile that can be used with this example. The OAuth profile also has a client app configured that can be used -- `client-assisted-example`.

If you are not using the sample configuration, then you need to make sure the following configuration changes are made before you use this example.

1. Login into the `Admin UI` and make sure that you have uploaded a valid license under `System -> General`.

2. Go to `Token Service` profile and make sure that at least `Implicit Flow` and `Assisted Token` are enabled on the `Client Settings` page of that profile.

3. Go to the `Clients` page of the profile and create a client called `client-assisted-example`.

4. This client (accessible from `Token Service -> Clients -> client-assisted-example -> Edit Client`) should have `Implicit Flow` and `Assisted Token` capabilities selected under the `Capabilities` section.

5. Navigate to `OAuth/OpenID Settings` section make sure to add `openid` scope.

6. Update the `Redirect URIs` and `Allowed Origins` settings for the `client-assisted-example` Client. The redirect URI should have `http://localhost:4200`. This is the URL where the Angular CLI will be hosting the SPA. The allowed origin should be the same or, for testing purposes, you can also use `*`.

7. `Commit` the changes and you are all setup.

If you compare the final config with the sample config, then you will find the following salient differences.

```xml
<client-store>
    <config-backed>
        <client>
            <id>client-assisted-example</id>
            <redirect-uris>http://localhost:4200</redirect-uris>
            <allowed-origins>*</allowed-origins>
            <capabilities>
                <implicit/>
                <assisted-token/>
            </capabilities>
        </client>
        <!-- ... -->
    </config-backed>
</client-store>
```

## Integrating with an Angular App

To integrate this example into actual Angular app, you need to copy `AppComponent` (`app.component.html` and `app.component.ts`) into your project and add this component into your app module. The second thing that is needed is to copy the `AuthInterceptor.ts` and `assistant.service.ts` files into your project and add them into your Module providers as shown below.

```typescript
@NgModule({
	declarations: [AppComponent],
	imports: [BrowserModule, HttpClientModule],
	providers: [
		AssistantService,
		{
			provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,
			useClass: AuthInterceptor,
			multi: true
		}
	],
	bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

You also need to add `HttpClientModule` in your Module imports as shown in the above code.

The last thing required is to configure the environment variables like `issuer`, `clientId`, `apiUrl` and `authServerOrigin`. The following is an example of these environment configuration settings (which are similar to those in `src/environments/*.ts`):

```typescript
export const environment = {
	production: false,
	issuer: "https://localhost:8443/",
	clientId: "client-assisted-example",
	apiUrl: "http://127.0.0.1:8100",
	authServerOrigin: "http://127.0.0.1:8100",
	openIdConfigurationUrl: "oauth/v2/oauth-anonymous/.well-known/openid-configuration"
};
```

## Building the Sample

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist` directory. Use the `-prod` flag to create a production build.
